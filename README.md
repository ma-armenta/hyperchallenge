# Conclusion
As data was filtered and cleaned, it can be used to possibly identify relationships between air temperature and wind speed rates.
One can check those points on the graph where temperate was at its lowest, then compare to average wind speeds and see that there is not a 
direct relationship from a high wind speed to a low temperature. Therefore high wind speed is not a direct factor to air temperature.
